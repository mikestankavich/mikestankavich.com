## 📝 Editing guide

### Site info

To edit site info such as site title and description, edit the `src/site.config.ts` file.

### Page contents

To edit the resume homepage content and design, edit the `src/pages/index.astro` file.
To edit the cv data, open the src/data.yaml file and edit as you need.

### Page components

To edit page components found site-wide such as the card used in the homepage, edit the files found in the `src/components/` directory.

### Layouts

To edit the base layouts of the resume page, edit the `src/layouts/Base.astro` file.

To edit the layout of all other pages, edit the `src/layouts/BaseBlog.astro` file.

To edit the layout of a blog article, edit the `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro` file.

### Blog content

To add blog content, insert `.md` files in the `src/content/` directory.

To add images in blog articles, insert a folder in the `src/content/` directory, add both the `.md` and image files into the new folder, and reference the image in your `.md` file.

## 👨🏻‍🎨 Theming

To change the theme colours of the site, edit the `src/styles/app.css` file.

To change the fonts of the site, add your font files into `/public`, add it as a `@font-face` in the `src/styles/app.css` file, as a `fontFamily` in the `tailwind.config.js` file, and apply the new font class to the `main` tag in the `src/layouts/Base.astro` or `src/layouts/BaseBlog.astro` file.

To change the background, edit the classes on the `body` tag in the `src/layouts/Base.astro` or `src/layouts/BaseBlog.astro` file. If you would like to add an image as the background, simple add it to the `/public/` folder and reference it on the `body` tag in the `src/layouts/Base.astro` or `src/layouts/BaseBlog.astro` file via tailwind classes.
